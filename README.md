# gradescope-io-viewer
L's Gradescope Input/Output Viewer is a Windows WPF app that lets you more easily view the test inputs and expected outputs for a Gradescope code submission.

It expects a folder containing an "Inputs" and a "RefOutputs" folder, each containing corresponding txt files. For each file in the "Inputs" folder, there should be a file in the "RefOutputs" folder with the same filename (with "RefOutput_" appended to the beginning). For example, "[folder]\Inputs\Case1.txt" and "[folder]\RefOutputs\RefOutput_Case1.txt".

"L's Gradescope I/O Viewer" is in no way associated with Gradescope or Turnitin, LLC. Test results may not always match gradescope results.
